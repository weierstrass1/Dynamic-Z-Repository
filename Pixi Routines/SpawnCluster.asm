;of the calling sprite and returns the sprite index in Y
;For a list of extended sprites see here: http://www.smwiki.net/wiki/RAM_Address/$7E:170B

;Input:  A   = number
;        $00 = 
;        $04 = x offset  \
;        $05 = y offset  | you could also just ignore these and set them later
;
;Output: Y   = index to extended sprite (#$FF means no sprite spawned)
;        C   = Carry Set = spawn failed, Carry Clear = spawn successful.
